# Summary
The goal of these experiments is to evaluate the impact of various approaches on the classification of out-of-domain (OOD) utterances, in a pure NLU pipeline.

## Datasets
Two distinct datasets have been used.

### Smart Home
This dataset contains 19 intents which cover the following use cases:
- Lights
- Music
- Thermostat

### Snips Assistant
This dataset contains 33 intents which cover the following use cases:
- Timer
- Alarm
- Navigation
- Time Info
- Weather
- Yes/No

## Noise generation
Two distinct ways of generating noise have been evaluated:

### Unigram Noise (UNo)
OOD utterances (noise) are generated by sampling unigrams based on their frequency, and concatenating them to form utterances:

    "more the ride you me get green"

### Bigram Noise (BiNo)
OOD utterances (noise) are generated by sampling bigrams based on their frequency, and concatenating them to form utterances

    "having a at times a personal the game"

Bigrams are sampled independently, meaning that the concatenation creates bigrams that may be very rare, if not impossible, like ``"a at"`` in the example above.

### LM Noise (LMNo)
OOD utterances (noise) are generated by sampling bigrams based on their frequency, by conditioning to the previous unigram.
If there is no bigram which starts with the previous unigram, then a new bigram is sampled from scratch.
This technique limits the problem of rare/impossible bigrams generated by the Bigram Noise (BiNo).

## Classification Model

Two different models are evaluated:
- Unigrams (Uni)
- Cooccurrences (Coo)

## Results

Cross validation metrics are run with 5-folds.
Out of domain utterances are sampled from difference OOD source in order to generate positive examples of the None class:

- subtitles: 1000 utterances sampled randomly from a subtitles source
- None: no OOD generated, hence there can only be false positive for the OOD class
- assistant: 269 utterances coming from assistant samples from Amazon Alexa

Both the Macro-average F1 (all intents), and the OOD F1 (F1 of the None class only) are reported.
